Welcome to PyUnity's documentation!
===================================
PyUnity is a Python implementation of the
Unity Engine, written in C++. This is just
a fun project and many features have been
taken out to make it as easy as possible
to create a scene and run it.

Installing
----------
To install PyUnity, use pip::

   > pip install pyunity

Its dependencies are just OpenGL, Pygame and
GLFW.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository
`here <https://github.com/rayzchen/pyunity>`_.
Then run setup.py::

   > python setup.py install

Note: we are having some difficulties right now.
To install a working copy, you cannot use the
simple ``pip install pyunity`` command. Instead,
clone the repository from above. Next, you
have to set the environment variable ``cython``
to a value that is not ``1``. Then you can run
``python setup.py install``. This issue is
being worked on and you can see its progress at
this `issue <https://github.com/rayzchen/pyunity/issues/2>`_.

Sometimes on Linux machines, Pygame cannot be
installed via pip: in that case, use the
package manager. For example, on Ubuntu::

   > sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
