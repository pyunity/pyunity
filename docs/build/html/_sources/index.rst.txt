Welcome to PyUnity's documentation!
===================================
PyUnity is a Python implementation of the
Unity Engine, written in C++. This is just
a fun project and many features have been
taken out to make it as easy as possible
to create a scene and run it.

Installing
----------
To install PyUnity, use pip:

   pip install pyunity

Its dependencies are just OpenGL, Pygame and
GLFW.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository
`here <https://github.com/rayzchen/PyUnity>`_.
Then run setup.py:

   python setup.py install

Sometimes on Linux machines, Pygame cannot be
installed via pip: in that case, use the
package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

   sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
