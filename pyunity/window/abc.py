    Abstract base class that window providers

        Sets the resize function, which has a signature
        of ``def Resize(width, height):``. This should
        be bound to the appropriate callback handler
        of the window.

    def getMouse(self, mousecode, keystate):
        """
        Get mouse state for specific mouse button
        and state.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mousecode : MouseCode
            Query button
        keystate : KeyState
            Query state

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            If the query button matches the query state.
            Note that both :attr:`KeyState.PRESS` and
            :attr:`KeyState.DOWN` will match a query
            of :attr:`KeyState.PRESS` because when a button
            is first hit it is still pressed down.

        Notes
        -----
        A good starting point is this example function:

        .. code-block:: python

            def getMouse(self, mousecode, keystate):
                mouse = mouseMap[mousecode]

                if self.mouse[mouse] == keystate:
                    return True
                return False

        where ``mouseMap`` is a mapping of :class:`MouseCode` to
        the window provider's own representation of mouse buttons,
        `self.mouse` is a mapping of the window provider's own
        representation of mouse buttons to :class:`KeyState`. This
        makes it easy to both query and set the keystates of the mouse.
